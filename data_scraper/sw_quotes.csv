character,quote
Leia Organa,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
C-3PO,"I suggest a new strategy, Artoo"
Darth Vader,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Han Solo,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,That’s no moon. It's a space station.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,Who's the more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows him?
Obi-Wan Kenobi,You don’t need to see his identification. …These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.
Han Solo,It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.
Leia Organa,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Luke Skywalker,I have a very bad feeling about this.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
Darth Vader,"When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master."
Luke Skywalker,It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home; they're not much bigger than two meters.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Use the Force, Luke."
Han Solo,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
Han Solo,I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
Han Solo,"Laugh it up, fuzzball."
Leia Organa,"Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking…nerf-herder!"
Han Solo,Punch it!
Han Solo,Never tell me the odds.
Yoda,Ah! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
Han Solo,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.

Yoda,Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Yoda,"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter."

Luke Skywalker,I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you. Anakin Skywalker
Qui-Gon Jinn,The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future. Qui-Gon Jinn

Qui-Gon Jinn,Your focus determines your reality.
Anakin Skywalker,"Sometimes, we must let go of our pride, and do what is requested of us."
Padmé,All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.

Yoda,"No longer certain that one ever does win a war, I am."
Force Priestess,"All that surrounds us is the foundation of life. The birthplace of what your science calls 'midi-chlorians.' The foundation of what connects the living Force and the cosmic Force. When a living thing dies, all is renewed. Life passes from the living Force into the cosmic Force and becomes one with it. One powers the other. One is renewed by the other."
Padmé Amidala,So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause.
Chancellor Palpatine,Do it.

Obi-Wan Kenobi,Hello there.
Wrecker,Why'd you tell me we're out of rations? Now I'm starving.
Tech,Understanding you does not mean that I agree with you.
Echo,"It's ironic. Clones wanted names instead of numbers, yet now people are signing up to be given numbers."
Hunter,Blind allegiance makes you a pawn. A real leader protects his squad.
Lando Calrissian,Everything you've heard about me is true.
Lando Calrissian,You need anything? L3
Qi'ra,What should we drink to? Han Solo
Rio Durant,Have you ever tried to disinvite a Wookie to anything? Not a good idea.
Grand Inquisitor,There are some things far more frightening than death.

Maz Kanata,"The Force, it's calling to you. Just let it in."
Yoda,"Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength. Mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters."
Luke Skywalker,What do you see? Rey
Luke Skywalker,We've passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight.

Eedy Karn,"You might as well wear a sign that says, 'I promise to disappoint you.'"
Cassian Andor,I'd rather die trying to take them down than die giving them what they want.
Luthen Rael,I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I’ll never see.
